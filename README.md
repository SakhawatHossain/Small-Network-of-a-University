# University Small Network Project

This project is a simulation of a small university network using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network consists of three departments: CSE, BBA, and EEE, each with their own router(network). Additionally, there is an seperate admin and a server site. All department routers and admin router connect to the university's main router, which is linked to an ISP router. The ISP router connects to a simulated "Google" switch, providing external access.

### Features:
- **Routing Protocols:**
  - Implemented both RIP and Static Routing.
  
- **Access Control Lists (ACL):**
  - Applied ACL for traffic filtering and access restrictions.

- **Network Address Translation (NAT):**
  - NAT is configured for IP address management between the internal network and the external ISP.

### Project Components:
- **Switches:**  6
- **Router:** # 6
- **Server Site:** Centralized server setup for the university
- **ISP Connection:** Direct connection to an external network (Google switch)

### How to Run:
1. Open the `.pkt` file in Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Test network connectivity between departments and the external network.
3. Experiment with RIP, static routing, ACL, and NAT configurations.

### Project Report:
A detailed report on the network design, configuration, and protocols implemented can be found in the [Project Report](./Project_Report.pdf).
